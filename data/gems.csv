Rvol downloads options chains, calculates implied volatilites for them and has features  to list top 10 type of lists for potential investment opportunities. Put call ratios are calculated ,  total amount of puts or calls for a particular company etc are available. These can be used to measure market sentiment. Different filters can be used to find stocks/options with high volatilities, stocks with  high options volume for the day etc which are indicators of forthcoming events. Rvol concentrates on the S&P500 at the moment. At anytime rvol can be used to download a snapshot from the market including stock prices, options chains, and earnings events for the month ahead.

You use the generator to build the page files. After the page has been updated you can use the validator to go through all of the selenium locators you are using in your page file and return a list of the locators that it could not find. If there are missing locators you can then rerun the generator to generate new selenium locators for your page. http://www.scottcsims.com
